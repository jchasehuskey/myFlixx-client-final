Implementing React to build the client-side for an application called myFlix-client-final that will utilize its existing server-side code (REST API and MongoDB). The application is a single-page application (SPA) and uses state routing to navigate between views and sharing URLs.

This repository contains the client side for my web application MyFlixx, built with React. The web application uses the MERN stack to provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

Features
Return a list of ALL movies to the user
Return data (description, genre, director, image URL, whether it’s featured or not) about a single movie by title to the user
Return data about a genre (description) by name/title (e.g., “Horror”)
Return data about a director (bio, birth year, death year) by name
Allow new users to register
Allow users to update their user info (username, password, email, date of birth)
Allow users to add a movie to their list of favorites
Allow users to remove a movie from their list of favorites
Allow existing users to deregister
JWT token-based users authentication
